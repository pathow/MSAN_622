	<h1>Project Dataset</h1>
<p>For this project, I have decided to use a dataset covering all economic crises and foreign policy militarized disputes for 70+ countries over the years 1816-2001. I would like to use this data because this was the central dataset of my prior Master's thesis trying to find a correlation between the economic crises and conflict around the world. I think that there is a chance to create some really interesting visuals that could be worthwhile outside of the specific context of this class.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>
My main data can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/pathow/MSAN_622/tree/gh-pages/project">Project Repo</a>. Since it is a composite dataset of my own making, this repo is really the only place that it exists in its entirety. The primary file (crises_full.csv) contains 15,413 rows and 61 columns -- not all of these variables would be directly useful, i.e., some are just informational columns about data sources/merges, but most convey some kind of information directly. In general, the structure of this data is geographical time series, with each row representing a year for a given country. I would want to play around some with potential visualizations before settling on which data columns would be of the most interest to visualize, but most are numeric and/or count variables (for example, number of economic crises in that country in that year). I envision being able to possibly make a world map that shows the spread of economic crises across borders over years, etc. I've also included a smaller dataset tracking only wars between countries, in case I decide that I'd rather just make a visual along the lines of "a visual history of all wars".</p>

<h2>Sources</h2>
<p>This data was cobbled together from a variety of public academic sources. As such, they are open for use, with proper citation, and as long as no profit is being made on the data. The sources of data that went into this larger dataset include <a href="http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/data/">Reinhart and Rogoff</a> for economic crisis data, and multiple subdatasets from the <a href="http://www.correlatesofwar.org/">Correlates of War</a> project data, which is widely used in international relations academia.
